Overall, I've made great strides not only in my knowledge but UI/UX of becoming a full-fledged developer. I continous love to learn and build out all my skills, in concepts, theories and breakdown of practiticum. It has not only been a formidable challenge but so exciting to learn and grow through the different challenges! 

I really hit a pinacle where learning became my main focus and started focusing on the syntax, functions & growth of the overall process. I love this experience and everyting up to it, and I will never stop developing and building my skills in engineering. Such a great place to be and tackle into.
