INDUCES THANK GOD FOR THE FRUITS APP AND CRUD

Authentication / FRUITS APP

MONGO DB Connected // Tested and With CRUD AND INDUCES
// Live server

// Cite Everything
// Partials are for everything! 

Check the Routes with the other code and make it so that it works out.
But this is looking pretty great ngl.
Once I get it figured out. It will be smooth sailing fromhere.

Other hard piece is the Authentication.


// HEROKU

// Design Is LAST!

// SAve Blog Post -> Route Handler for all the buttons
    // Update Account Info

    This is my CRUD AND INDUCSE Practice!

    This is what I am going to be known for. It's not impossible. Just get it done!

    // Cannot get Login

    // Getting caught up. But this is looking really good with bare bones. 
    As long as I get the CRUD / INDUCES/ Login SETUP.
    // And Launch it to the Server with Mongo with that video I am good to go.

    Let's fucking built it out. 
    Make sure to submit it and cite everything that is required and needed!

    // Routes are looking great. All I need to do is now add the functions. that what controllers are for. Make it as simple as possible. It will allow me to tackle into more of this space. I will make sure to break everything down and fight for my SPOT!

    I appreciate them and I really do Like Justin and Billie The best type of people!


    Calling back data is amazing. Let's see how they make that blog and then add that piece to my own website this will be amazing.

i need to get this all done for the editing field of what we need. this doesnt need to be edited or deleted. This is only update.
That's all we need.

Patch is a better function.
I will have to seek what the looks like exactly.
Breakdown each Function.

Why are you talking to me.

Literally finish your code. That is what we have to do. 
IDK why you don't care about it atm. It's not cool for you to do that. Once they are ready. I need to gather all my intel.

Circle of Tonight - This is the Process. Let's Get it! 

1. Trial and Error
2. Learning
3. Documentation
4. Implementation
5. Trial and Error
6. Check for What's Needed Next
7. Optmize
8. Back to the Top

I am well equiped and I can finish this tonight! Let's Make sure to get it. And style and get it done TN. Get those styles done ASAP! 

I needed the Visual so I can work through it, this is why it's great!

Looking Good. How do I design it?

That's what I want and then I can add the function now! This is definitely so much fun!

Modular Approach this is how we take it and build off of what is available. Adding in the quotation and adding in the details of modular function is what is necessary.

Now this place is a catch all like a SEO or Funnel. This is the perfect Funnel. And now we can just add it in. It is looking like it's coming together for real! All I need is the functionality and the Design and then I am ready!

Change the Color and all is well that ends amazing.

Simple function and then have a place where we see all the Blogs in one place

Make it just Practice and Use POSTMAN. Is all you need!

// FIll In Details - DO a POSTMAN Connection Piece - Extrapulate the data

POST // updateStatus

POST // updateAccountInfo

POST // updateBasicInfo

POST // updateContactInfo

POST // updateEducationInfo

POST // saveBlogPost

 hit them in the Partials that is what we have to edit. This will be a great app. I already know it.
 I need to make sure the authentication works out.

 I will be caught up with everything and make sure it works out.


Get it for Profile & Blogs
Have it with the database

And that is what I need to build and then carry on that way.
